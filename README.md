## Machine Learning for Bank Customer Churn Prediction

### Description
Bank Beta customers are gradually leaving the company, their numbers are decreasing every month. Bank employees realize that it would be more cost-effective for the company to focus on retaining their loyal customers rather than attracting new ones.

In this case, our task is to predict whether a customer will soon leave the bank or not. You have data related to the clients' behavior in the past and their history of contract termination with the bank.

Create a model with the maximum possible F1 score. To pass the review, you need a minimum F1 score of 0.59 for the test dataset. Check the F1 score for the test set.

Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score.

### Objectives
The objectives for this research are:
1. Build first model without adjusting for imbalance.
2. Conduct sanity check.
3. Improve the model until the F1 score is more than equals to 0.59.
